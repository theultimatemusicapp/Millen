<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
MusicRevolution was founded by two musicians, <strong>Reuben</strong> and <strong>Carl</strong>, who have both worked in multiple areas of the music industryâ€”from playing in bands and DJing to creating music videos and being signed to labels. They realized how much of a struggle the music industry is, with intermediaries often taking a large share of the profits. Determined to make a change, they created this platform to return the power and profits back to the artists and venues.
