<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
MusicRevolution was founded by two passionate individuals, <strong>Reuben Hester</strong>, a British-born artist, and <strong>Carl Tomich</strong>, a documentary filmmaker and DJ known for the film "Busking for Berlin". Both Reuben and Carl have extensive experience in various facets of the music industryâ€”from performing in bands and DJing to creating music videos and being signed to labels. Witnessing firsthand the struggles that artists face, they joined forces to create a platform aimed at revitalizing a dying industry by empowering musicians and venues alike.
